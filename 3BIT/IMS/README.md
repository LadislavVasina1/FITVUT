# Simulation in the domain of "Ballistics in the military"

### Description
The goal of this pair project was to propose a model and construct a simulation using the [SIMLIB/C++](https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~peringer/SIMLIB/) simulation library.
We chose to simulate the capabilities of the anti-air missile defence system (Iron Dome).
This included creating/designing a petri net model, then trasfering it into code (SIMLIB) and doing experiments on it.
Detailed report created for our findings.
Code available [here](https://github.com/IMS-20222/ims) or in the `src` folder.
